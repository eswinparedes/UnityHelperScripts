# UnityHelperScripts
 A collection of Helpful Scripts, version 3

Has a dependency for UniRX available for free on the Unity Asset Store.

This is an updated version of SimpleUnityHelperScripts.  The changes from this version from last are huge and incompatible.  Since there where projects that used the last version I have published the updates on a new repository and the SimpleUnityHelperScripts will no longer be updated or supported.
